* Programs must communicate clearly to people.

* Use elements of good composition where applicable.
	* eg: use a space after a comma, not before.

* Confusion must be avoided.

* If there is a feature of a language that is sometimes problematic, and if it can be replaced with another feature that is more reliable, then always use the more reliable feature.
	* eg: use `===` instead of `==`

* Avoid forms that are difficult to distinguish from common errors.

* Make your programs look like what they do.
