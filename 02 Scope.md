* Block scope vs function scope.

* Rules:
	* Declare all variables at the top of the function.
	* Declare all functions before you call them.
	* Let there be `let`

* Global variables
	* Global variables are evil.
	* Avoid global variables
	* Be explicit: `UPPER_CASE`

* Constructor functions should be named with InitialCaps. (and nothing else should be)
